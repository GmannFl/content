comment: "This script is used to simplify the process of creating a new record in\
  \ Archer. You can add fields that you want in the record as script arguments and\
  \ or in the code and have a newly created record easily.\n\nThis automation is currently\
  \ used for Archer application 75 (Security Incidents) but can be altered to any\
  \ other application by entering another application Id as input and or modifying\
  \ the default ApplicationId value in the arguments. \nAnother option would be to\
  \ duplicate this script and adjust it to the new application Id.\n\nPlease note\
  \ that if you will change it to work with another application some of the argument\
  \ defined fields might need to be changed as they belong to application 75."
