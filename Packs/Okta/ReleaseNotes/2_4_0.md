#### Integrations
##### Okta v2
Fixed bug in static method get_readable_logs where the variable 'device' was not always defined for an if statement that referenced the variable. Indented the if statement once so the 'device' variable will always be defined when the if statement is executed.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.1.26972*.
