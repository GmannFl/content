    "description": "The playbook in this content pack provides a two button version of a playbook that emulates SlackAsk, but can be flexibly modified to add more buttons or simply have greater customization of the two button SlackAsk interaction. It also adds a response capability in which a slack user and analyst will be put into contact in the event that a user responds that an event is unexpected. ",
