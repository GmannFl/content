##### SentinelOne v2
NSTR
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.1.26972*.

#### Playbooks
##### New: SentinelOne - Check for New File Upload Activity - Inner Loop
- Playbook called inside a loop by  "SentinelOne - Check for New File Upload Activity". Does the actual poll of the SentinelOne Activity feed, then sleeps for 15 seconds if no result is found. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 0.0.0).
##### Sentinel One - Endpoint data collection
New Playbook for exercising `sentinelone-fetch-file and sentinel-one-download-fetched-file
Playbook 1 of 3
##### New: SentinelOne - Check for New File Upload Activity
- Playbook to abstract out process of polling for  an Activity to appear in the SentinelOne Activity feed after a file upload has been requested.

We did not use GenericPolling due to a difference in semantics. GenericPolling expects a value to show up in the context when results are incomplete, and then for that value to disappear when results are present or the action is incomplete.

SentinelOne returns *no* results when incompleted, then results when complete - the opposite of GenericPolling semantics. This seemed to be the cleanest way to implement this contract.

 (Available from Cortex XSOAR 0.0.0).
