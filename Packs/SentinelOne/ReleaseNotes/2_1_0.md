#### Integrations
##### SentinelOne v2
Added the following commands:
*sentinelone-get-blocklist* - List out contents of a block list
*sentinelone-add-hash-to-blocklist* - Add a hash to a block list
*sentinelone-remove-hash-from-blocklist* - Remove a hash from a block list
*sentinelone-fetch-file* - Initiate a file fetch command against an endpoint
*sentinelone-download-fetched-file* - Download a file fetched with the *sentinelone-fetch-file* command.
**Note:** SentinelOne uses the term "blacklist" in their documentation/API. This was modified to use the term "blocklist" in the integration commands.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.1.26972*.
