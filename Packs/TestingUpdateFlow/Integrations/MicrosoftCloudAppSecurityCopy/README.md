Microsoft Cloud App Security is a multimode Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB). It provides rich visibility, control over data travel, and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyber threats across all your cloud services. Use the integration to view and resolve alerts, view activities, view files, and view user accounts.
This integration was integrated and tested with version xx of MicrosoftCloudAppSecurity_copy

## Configure MicrosoftCloudAppSecurity_copy on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for MicrosoftCloudAppSecurity_copy.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Server URL (e.g., https://example.net) |  | True |
    | User's key to access the API |  | True |
    | Fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Incident type |  | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |

    | Custom Filter | A custom filter by which to filter the returned files. If you pass the custom_filter argument it will override the other filters from the integration instance configuration. An example of a Custom Filter is: \{"severity":\{"eq":2\}\}. Note that for filtering by "entity.policy", you should use the ID of the policy. For example, for retrieving the policy: \{"policyType": "ANOMALY_DETECTION", "id": "1234", "label": "Impossible travel", "type": "policyRule"\}" please query on \{"entity.policy":\{"eq":1234\}\}. For more information about filter syntax, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/api-alerts\#filters. | False |
