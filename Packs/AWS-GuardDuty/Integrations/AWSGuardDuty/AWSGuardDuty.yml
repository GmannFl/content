  Amazon Web Services Guard Duty Service (gd)
  This extension is specifically to add 4 GD enablement commands:
  aws-gd-create-member
  aws-gd-invite-member
  aws-gd-list-invitations
  aws-gd-accept-invitation
  the commands are designed to handle one input at a time since AWS does not return anything for some of the commands where they are successfully executed
