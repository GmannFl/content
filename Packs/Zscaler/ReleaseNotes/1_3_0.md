Added the following lines at 439 and 440 to add formatting between URL classifications instead of bunching them together without spacing.
            if len(data['urlClassifications']) >= 1:
                data['urlClassifications'] = ', '.join(data['urlClassifications'])
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python:2.7.18.27799*.
