#### Integrations
##### IBM Resilient Systems
Three updates to Resilient version 1.0.10 3061129:
1. Fix to support multi-tenancy and/or customers with non-default IDs for lookups
2. New: data table functionality
3. Fix bugs in code
1. Fix Tenancy/ID changes
-------------------------
Resilient marketplace integration does not support multi-tenancy, or single tenant Resilient solutions that is not 'out of the box configured'. 
This ID/tenancy issue is shown by all the dictionaries for lookups being hard coded numerics, e.g. RESOLUTION_DICT for 'Unresolved' is 7 in the integration, but can be something else in Resilient. For multi-tenancy, each tenant MUST have a different value as IDs must be unique, so all of these hard-coded values will always fail, e.g. tenant 1 is 7, tenant 2 is 2007, etc.
This also simplifies the code by replacing 'change' method with 'patch' method which takes names not IDs and old/new names/values are not required, simply the new value as patch does all the work
Most of this is within the command rs-update-incident
2. New Table functions
-------------------
Top level functions added to populate and use Resilient data tables:
- get_table_command
- update_table_command
3. Fix Bugs
-----------
1. incident_id is used in various string concatenations but not always converted to a string so will fail.
2. enhancement (#13657) via commit 7521e4f411de7eeebbdcfeae015cad44512cd528 added a bug where all dropdown/enum values
	return ID numbers, e.g. '1188' instead of 'Yes' due to how text_content_output_format works
	it requires handle_format=names. In addition, refer to code for other reasons and options
3. extract_data_form_other_fields_argument spelled incorrectly, should be extract_data_from_other_fields_argument
4. changes to get incident to support html causes enum strings to be returned as numbers and forces div blocks around plain text. Refer to get_incident to add html back in if required by integration
All lint warnings/errors are from the existing code
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/resilient:1.0.0.24033*.
