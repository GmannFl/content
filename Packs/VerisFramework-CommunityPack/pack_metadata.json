    "description": "The Pack includes all Incident Fields and selections to make use of the Veris Framework.\n\nThe Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. VERIS is a response to one of the most critical and persistent challenges in the security industry - a lack of quality information. VERIS targets this problem by helping organizations to collect useful incident-related information and to share that information - anonymously and responsibly - with others. The overall goal is to lay a foundation from which we can constructively and cooperatively learn from our experiences to better measure and manage risk. This site serves as a central hub for all things VERIS. On it, you will find information and resources for leveraging VERIS in your organization as well as interacting with the growing community of users. We hope you'll become part of that community, and help build a set of valuable information that benefits us all.",
